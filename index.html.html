        <h1>Solar Energy</h1>
        <br>
        <div class="source">
            <img src="pic\solar.jpg" alt="Solar Energy">
            <p>Solar energy is a renewable energy source that is harnessed from the sun's rays. It is a clean and sustainable way to generate electricity, and it can be used in a variety of applications, from powering homes and businesses to charging electric vehicles.</p>
            <p>Solar energy is a popular choice for eco-friendly energy because it produces no emissions or pollutants. It is also a scalable technology, which means that it can be used to generate large amounts of electricity or to power small devices. Additionally, solar energy can be stored in batteries, making it a reliable source of power even when the sun is not shining.</p>

        <h1>Wind Energy</h1>
        <br>
        <div class="source">
            <img src="pic\wind.jpg" alt="Wind Energy">
            <p>Wind energy is a renewable energy source that is harnessed from the wind. It is a clean and sustainable way to generate electricity, and it can be used in a variety of applications, from powering homes and businesses to providing electricity to entire communities.</p>
            <p>Wind energy is a popular choice for eco-friendly energy because it produces no emissions or pollutants. It is also a scalable technology, which means that it can be used to generate large amounts of electricity or to power small devices. Additionally, wind energy can be used in conjunction with other renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, to provide a reliable source of power.</p>

        <h1>Hydroelectric Energy</h1>
        <br>
        <div class="source">
            <img src="pic\Hydro.jpg" alt="Hydroelectric Energy">
            <p>Hydroelectric energy is a renewable energy source that is harnessed from the movement of water. It is a clean and sustainable way to generate electricity, and it can be used in a variety of applications, from powering homes and businesses to providing electricity to entire communities.</p>
            <p>Hydroelectric energy is a popular choice for eco-friendly energy because it produces no emissions or pollutants. It is also a scalable technology, which means that it can be used to generate large amounts of electricity or to power small devices. Additionally, hydroelectric energy can be stored in reservoirs, making it a reliable source of power even when water levels are low.</p>

        <h1>Biogas Energy</h1>
        <br>
        <div class="source">
            <img src="pic\bio'.jpg" alt="biogas Energy">
            <p>Biogas may be used to power machinery, particularly combined heat and power (CHP) engines. Desotec’s sustainable mobile filtration solutions remove contaminants to protect equipment: e.g., siloxanes, which are abrasive, and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), which causes corrosion and the acidification of the engine oil.

                There are also health, odour control, and environmental grounds for removing H₂S, especially to prevent the formation of acid rain. Desotec sustainable mobile filtration will support you in producing green power for Europe.</p>
